# word-guess-game

This is a fun game with pizzaz.


Guessing which letters are in the word will appear in the appropriate location.

If a letter is required again, you have to enter it.

An incorrect letter will be listed under “Letters Used”.

Keystroke letters until you can guess the word or run out of allottable chances. 

The game will not reflect any action if a used letter is keystroked again.

If you guess the word correctly, you win.

Your score will be tallied for cumulative wins and losses.

Have fun!
